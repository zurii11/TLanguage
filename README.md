# TLanguage
This is a simple stack-based language like Forth. The thing is, I don't actually know porth, this is heavelly inpired by Porth, Forth implemented in python by github.com/tsoding. Great guy, check him out.

Right now it can only push integers to stack, add, substract and dump them to standard output.

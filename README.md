# TLanguage
This is a simple stack-based language like Forth. The thing is, I don't actually know porth, this is heavelly inpired by Porth, Forth implemented in python by github.com/tsoding. Great guy, check him out.

Right now it can only push integers to stack, add, substract and dump them to standard output.

This is in no way to be used for any real development. Not expect anything from this. It's just a personal project to satisfy my curiosity.

## Goals

1. Have it compiled to assembly.
2. Have it interpreted.
3. Turing complete

## TODOS

1. Read program from file
2. Error reporting
3. If, elseif and else
4. Loops
